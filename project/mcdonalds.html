  <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>McDonalds is global multibillion company that focuses its stores on fast food disregarding health. Their stores are distributed by franchisers around the world willing to make a profit off of fast food. Many of its fast foods vary by region for in Taiwan, it serves corn chowder.</p>
  <p>McDonalds the company itself rakes more money in real estate of franchisees than the sale of raw materials to its numerous stores. They buy very cheap potatoes from massive corporations that sell potatoes.</p>
  <p> The reason why these stores are very productive is due to a large handbook on how specifically how each product is made. Such as the exact parameters fries must be cut. This is known as the "Bible" by employees at McDonalds. If a store did not follow, they were immediately shut down.</p>
